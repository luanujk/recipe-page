# Recipe Page - Front Mentor

This is a modern and responsive website that I created as part of a FrontMentor challenge. The idea was to use the Bootstrap concepts that I have been learning lately.

## Features

* Responsive Design using Bootstrap Grid System

* Modern and Elegant Design

* Easy-to-Understand Code for Beginners

* Custom Styling using CSS alongside Bootstrap



## Main Objective

### Why Bootstrap?

*  I could have used just HTML and CSS to create it easily, but the challenge was precisely to leave my comfort zone and use concepts that I'm not yet so familiar with.
*  I understand that Bootstrap is still a great framework to work with, in addition to facilitating the creation of interfaces quickly and practically. In addition to being great for the transition between pure HTML/CSS and a more modern framework, such as Angular, it is also a framework that allows you to work on legacy projects.
